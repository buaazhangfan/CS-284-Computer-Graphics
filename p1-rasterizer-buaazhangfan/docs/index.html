<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
  In this project, we focused on the rasterization which is the fundamental of graphics rendering. Starting from the easiest triangle rasterization, 
  we went into deep knowledge like supersampling, transform, barycentric coordinates, texture mapping. Basically rasterization is a sampling process, 
  we need to express the continuous object in the 3D real word to pixel-wise images in 2D screen and a lot of our work was concentrating on how to do 
  antialiasing like supersampling, pixel sampling, level sampling. Also, texture mapping is anoter key point in this project. Instead of directly set 
  the color of an triangle, a texture map is used for sampling colors. With the help of barycentric coordinates, we can find the corresponding points in 
  screen space and texture space and then find the appropriate color.
</p>
<p>
  In conclusion, this project provided me with an overview of how images are rendered from fundamental patterns such as triangles. The whole project acts as 
  a small rendering program that renders .svg file to screen.

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>The Way to Rasterize Triangles</li>
    <p>
      The naive method I used to rasterize triangles is to detect every pixel in the bound-box of the given triangle and use the inside(tri, x, y) function to test whether the current point is inside the triangle or not. Since the triangle is given by three vertices V0, V1, V2,
      the edge function of three edges L0, L1, L2 which is defined from the lecture 2 can be used to check whether a pixel is inside the given triangle. One thing that needs to be considered is the 
      ordering of the 3 given vertices. If they are given by anticlockwise order, then for the given point (x,y), the point is inside the triangle when all the edge functions are larger or equal to zero.
      However, if the ordering of the 3 given vertices is clockwise, then the edge function should be smaller or equal to zero. in order to keep all the points with the same standard when doing point-in-triangle test,
      first we should check whether the given vertices are in anticlockwise order. 
    </p>
    <P>
      Checking the order of vertices is pretty easy, first we should get the vector of two edges V0V1 = (x1 - x0, y1 - y0) and V0V2 = (x2 - x0, y2 - y0)then doing the crossproduct of these
      two vectors, if the crossproduct result is larger than 0 then it is anticlockwise, if the crossproduct result is less than 0 then it is clockwise.
      For clockwise, we need to swap the {V1, V2} to get an anticlockwise ordering vertices.
    </P>
    <p>
      For the bound box of the given triangle, the range of <b>x</b> is defined as [min(x0, x1, x2), max(x0, x1, x2)] and the range of <b>y</b> is defined as [min(y0, y1, y2), max(y0, y1, y2)], then we traverse all the points in this range to do point-in-triangle test.
    </p>
    <li>Compared with the one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle</li>
    <p>
      The method that I used to rasterize triangles is the naive way to check each point in the bounding box of the triangle so it is the same method.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Supersampling</li>
    <p>
      The main framework of Supersampling is similiar with the Part1 but with two more loops. Because each pixel now is divided into several sub-pixels.
      So we need to look up each sub-pixel to check whether this sub-pixel is inside the given triangle and then fill the color to this sub-pixel. After looking up
      and filling all the sub-pixels inside the triangle, we average the color of a pixel with its sub-pixels. For each pixel, traversing all sub-pixels whthin it and 
      adding the R, G, B channel color of each sub-pixel and then averaging them. In this way, if not all sub-pixels are in the triangle, the overall color of the pixel
      will not be full colored and it can make the edge of the triangle more smooth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alisaing (jaggies) happens when the sample frequency is less than the Nyquist frequency so the method to do antialiasing is to increase the sample rate.
      Supersampling is the way to increase the sample rate because for each single pixel, supersampling does more samples inside it so it works. From the result
      it is obvious that in the edge of the rendered patterns, the pixels are not fully colored so the jaggies effect will be reduced by supersampling.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      From the above three results, when sampling rate is 1, for the triangle which the inspector points, some pixels around the skinny tiangle corner is 
      not connected with the main body of the triangle. Meanwhile, each pixel that inside the triangle is fully colored. When the sampling rate is 4,
      we can see that the corner pixels' color is lighter than pixels inside which results from the average of sub-pixels. Compared with sampling rate
      is 1, some pixels are colored but the triangle is still not connected. When the sampling rate increases to 16, we can see that all pixels are connected
      , this is because that each pixel now has 16 sub-pixels so more sub-pixels are inside the triangle that causes the pixel be colored.

    I designed this cubeman from the picture showed in the lecture. To render this cubeman, first I set its body in the middle of this picture as the toppest level in the 
    hierarchy as the base. Then based on the relative transorm infomation (Rotation, Translation), I set the first polygon of left/right leg, left/right arm, head as the second level. 
    Then in every second level, I set other polygons based on the transform information of their father polygon.

  <h3 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Barycentric coordinates</li>
    <p>
      Barycentric coordinates can be used to express the position of any point located inside the triangle with three scalars.
      In general, using barycentric coordinates, we can interpolate values that are defined by three verticles like position coordinates,
      and colors. It is like a linear operation for all three vertices so it is widly used in generate colors from three basic colors
      red, green and blue. I rendered a single triangle with one red, one green, and one blue vertex, and then it produced a smoothly blended color triangle.

  <h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Pixel Sampling</li>
    <p>
      Pixel Sampling is like doing a mapping from texture space to screen space. Since the texture map is also a discrete 2D image, so when using 
      the barycentric coordinates to transform (x, y) to (u, v), we need to choose which texture color we should apply to the pixel since for texture 
      map, the sampling points are texels. In the previous parts, we directly send a color to the given triangle while from this part, we sample colore 
      from texture map. It is a sampling process so we should do antialiasing. Since doing supersampling for texture is costly, we perform texture filting
      before sampling with bilinear filtering or directly choose the nearest texel to represent the color at (u, v).
    </p>
    <p>
      I used barycentric coordinates to do the mapping from screen space (x, y) to texture space (u, v). Then in the texture space, since 
      every sample point is in the middle position of a texel so there are two ways to decide the color in (u, v). For the nearest method, 
      it is simple because this algorithm finds the nearest sample point around (u, v) and then assign the color to (u, v). Another method is bilinear,
      which perform bilinear interpolation between the four texels nearest to the point that the pixel represents. So nearest is likely to generate some 
      jaggies in the thin edge of an object.

    </div>

    <li>Analysis</li>
    <p>
      From the results, we can see using nearest texel with sampling rate equals to 1 will generate obvious jaggies and some parts 
      of the images are broken. When increase the sample rate the result becomes better because of super-sampling. But the computational time 
      also increases obviously. For bilinear, when sampling rate equals to 1 it is already filtered so the jaggies effect is not so obvious 
      compared with the nearest. Same, when increase sampling rate to 16, bilinear also performs better than nearest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The difference between nearest and bilinear sampling is the most apparent in the map sample images, which have distinct thin vertical lines through them.
      Because in these areas, the difference of texture color of pixels around is distinct so when using nearest sampling, it is likely to choose the wrong texel.
      However, the bilinear sampling will interpolate colors from 4 nearest texels so the result will be smooth.
    </p>
  </ol>

  <h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Level Sampling</li>
    <p>
      Considering the texture minification, it is harder than texture magnification because in this case, one pixel corresponds to several texels. The mipmap is 
      used here to generate texture with different resolutions. The level sampling uses mipmap technology to scale high-resolution texture image into 
      multiple smaller-resolution texture maps within the same texture file. Each scaled down texture is called a "MIP level," and it represents how the original texture would look if it was a certain distance away from the camera or viewer. 
      Filters allow these different sized textures to represent colors and textures more naturally when being viewed from a distance. The idea is simple: If the image to be rendered is big or close, the renderer uses a low level texture map, 
      while if it is smaller or farther away, then smaller (high level) textures are used.
    </p>
    <p>
      I use the footprint methods to implement the level sampling. Choosing two neighboring pixels from screen space in x axis and y axis and mapping them into the texture space, 
      it is easy to calculate the foot distance between neighbouring pixels in the texture space. Between these two distances, the larger one is the footprint 
      from screen space to texture space. Since every level of mipmap is one half smaller than the upper level, we can get the continuous level value by calculating
      the logarithm of this distance based on 2. Since the level is discrete so we have two methods to choose the correct level. One is just choose the nearest level by round the value, the 
      other is to use two levels to interpolate the result. For example, if we get the value of level as 2.6, we shoud choose level 2 and level 3 and use 0.6 to interpolate.
    </p>
    <li>Differences between Pixel Sampling and Level Sampling</li>
    <p>
      I used the time class to compare the speed for different methods to sampling the texture. The overall speed for zoom in is slower than zoom out because when 
      zoom in, the program need to rasterize more pixels so it takes a long time. Since the result of directely using level 0 is much worse than other method, 
      so I only compare the performance of Level_Nearest/Level_Bilinear and Pixel_Nearest/Pixel_Bilinear as well as supersampling. The combination of Level_Bilinear 
      and Pixel_Bilinear has the best result. As a result of this, the running time is also longer than other combinations. However, compared with supersampling, 
      the Trilinear filter is much faster than supersampling while the performance is almost the same as supersampling at 16. 
    </p>
    <p>
      For the performance, the Trilinear method performs best with a relatively fast speed. From the result, there is nearly no jaggies after trilinear filter.
